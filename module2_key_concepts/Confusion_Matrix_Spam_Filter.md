## ðŸŽ¯ Visual Summary

|                | Predicted Spam | Predicted Not Spam |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Actual Spam    | TP             | FN                  |
| Actual Not Spam| FP             | TN                  |

## ðŸ§  What Each Term Means
TP (True Positive): Spam email correctly marked as spam.
FP (False Positive): Good email wrongly marked as spam.
FN (False Negative): Spam email wrongly marked as safe.

FP (False Positive) = False Alarm

FN (False Negative) = Missed Detection
The system thinks it's safe, but it's actually spam.
Like letting a scam email into your inbox.
