## ‚úÖ What Are Data Quality Checks?

Data quality checks are rules or validations applied to datasets before training or testing AI models. They help ensure the data is:
- Complete
- Accurate
- Consistent
- Valid
- Unique
- Timely

## üîç Why Are Data Quality Checks Important?

| Problem if Ignored         | Impact on AI Model                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Missing values             | Model confusion, inaccurate predictions     |
| Incorrect formats          | Errors during training                      |
| Duplicates                 | Overfitting, biased learning                |
| Outdated data              | Irrelevant predictions                      |
| Inconsistent units         | Misinterpretation of features               |
| Biased data                | Unfair or unethical decisions               |

## ‚úÖ Types of Data Quality Checks with Examples

### 1. Completeness
**Check**: Are all required fields present?
- **Bad Data**:
  ```json
  { "name": "Alok", "income": "", "credit_score": 750 }
  ```
- **Issue**: Missing income field.
- **QA Action**: Check for empty or null fields.

### 2. Accuracy
**Check**: Are values realistic and correct?
- **Bad Data**:
  ```json
  { "size": -1200, "location": "Bangalore", "price": 5000000 }
  ```
- **Issue**: Negative house size.
- **QA Action**: Validate numeric ranges.

### 3. Consistency
**Check**: Are formats and units consistent?
- **Bad Data**:
  ```json
  { "salary": "50000 INR" }, { "salary": "600 USD" }
  ```
- **Issue**: Mixed currencies.
- **QA Action**: Standardize units.

### 4. Validity
**Check**: Do values follow expected formats?
- **Bad Data**:
  ```json
  { "email": "alokgmail.com" }
  ```
- **Issue**: Invalid email format.
- **QA Action**: Use regex to validate formats.

### 5. Uniqueness
**Check**: Are there duplicate records?
- **Bad Data**: Same transaction ID repeated.
- **Issue**: Model may learn wrong patterns.
- **QA Action**: Remove duplicate rows.

### 6. Timeliness
**Check**: Is the data up-to-date?
- **Bad Data**: Using customer data from 2015.
- **Issue**: Outdated preferences.
- **QA Action**: Use recent records only.
